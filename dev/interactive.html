        <h1>A step-by-step look at abortions in Indiana</h1>
           <p>Before their 45th birthday, three in every ten women will have had an abortion. Most women seeking abortions are in their 20s and are already mothers.</p>

            <p>While the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed a woman’s right to receive an abortion, it also gave states more rights to regulate a woman’s ability to access one. </p>

            <p>Using three scenarios, this interactive shows how Indiana’s laws affect a woman’s attempt to obtain an abortion.</p>

            <p>Since the ruling went into effect, abortions in Indiana have declined by 23 percent. In 2011, 61 percent of Hoosier women lived in a county without a clinic authorized to perform abortions.</p>

            <p>Indiana passed HR1337 in 2016, which put nine new regulations on a woman’s access to abortion. A federal judge blocked this bill a week before being enacted, but State Rep. Curt Nisly announced he will introduce bill calling for the total ban on abortion in the next legislative session.</p>
