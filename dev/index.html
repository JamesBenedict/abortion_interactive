		<h1>A step by step look at abortions in Indiana</h1>


		<p>Before their 45th birthday, three in every ten women will have had an abortion. Most women seeking abortions are in their 20s and are already mothers.</p>
		
		<p>While the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v.Casey reaf rmed a woman’s right to receive an abortion, it also gave states more rights to regulate a woman’s ability to access
		one.</p>

		<p>Since the ruling went into effect, abortions in Indiana have
		declined by 23 percent. In 2011, 61 percent of Hoosier women
		lived in a county without a clinic authorized to perform abortions.</p>

		<p>Indiana passed HR1337 in 2016, which put nine new restrictions
		on a woman’s access to abortion. This interactive will introduce
		you to three characters stories and take you through the
		process of pursuing an abortion in Indiana.</p>

		<h2>Counseling</h2>

		<p>You make your appointment at the clinic and the rst step required by the state of Indiana is the provider counseling you against going through with the procedure. Below is a video of what they might tell you in a typical counseling session.</p>

		<p>That can be a lot to take in. Click next to continue your counseling visit. Remember you can always change your mind about getting an abortion.</p>

		<h2>Ultrasound</h2>
		<p>Indiana requires women seeking an abortion to receive an ultrasound during their counseling session and listen to their fetus’s heartbeat.</p>

		<p>Click next if you are still seeking an abortion.</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="page time_delay">
	<div class="card">
		<h2>Waiting period</h2>
		<p>Between your counseling appointment and your procedure, Indiana requires an 18-hour waiting period. This can be complicated by the fact that many clinics keep odd hours on only certain days of the week. To represent those 18 hours, please wait nine seconds before moving to the next step</p>
