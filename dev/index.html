					<h2>Intro</h2>
					<p>Before their 45th birthday, three in every ten women will have had an abortion. Most women seeking abortions are in their 20s and are already mothers.</p>
					<p>While the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed a woman’s right to receive an abortion, it also gave states more rights to regulate a woman’s ability to access one.</p>
					<p>Since the ruling went into effect, abortions in Indiana have declined by 23 percent. In 2011, 61 percent of Hoosier women lived in a county without a clinic authorized to perform abortions.</p>
					<p>Indiana passed HRXXX in 201X, which put nine new restrictions on a woman’s access to abortion. This interactive will introduce you to three characters stories and take you through the process of pursuing an abortion in Indiana</p>
