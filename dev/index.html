		<h1>A step by step look at abortions in Indiana</h1>

		<p>Before their 45th birthday, three in every ten women will have had an abortion. Most women seeking abortions are in their 20s and are already mothers.</p>
		
		<p>While the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v.Casey reaf rmed a woman’s right to receive an abortion, it also gave states more rights to regulate a woman’s ability to access
		one.</p>

		<p>Since the ruling went into effect, abortions in Indiana have
		declined by 23 percent. In 2011, 61 percent of Hoosier women
		lived in a county without a clinic authorized to perform abortions.</p>

		<p>Indiana passed HR1337 in 2016, which put nine new restrictions
		on a woman’s access to abortion. This interactive will introduce
		you to three characters stories and take you through the
		process of pursuing an abortion in Indiana.</p>

She thinks one of these jobs may turn into a full-time career and is hoping to get benefits then.</p>

		<p>Between your counseling appointment and your procedure, Indiana requires an 18-hour waiting period. This can be complicated by the fact that many clinics keep odd hours on only certain days of the week. To represent those 18 hours, please wait nine seconds before moving to the next step</p>

		<p>Your operation was successful. Most are. Less than one percent of abortions have a complication arise and they are considered 1/10th as dangerous as childbirth.</p>

		<p>Of course, there are still costs. You spent a week wearing a sanitary pad to work, bleeding more than you normally would even on your period, but you gure that’s a small price to pay.</p>
