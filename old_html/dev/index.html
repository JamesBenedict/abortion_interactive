					<h2>A step-by-step look at abortions in Indiana</h2>
					<p>Before their 45th birthday, three in every ten women will have had an abortion. Most women seeking abortions are in their 20s and are already mothers.</p>

					<p>While the 1992 Supreme Court case Planned Parenthood v. Casey reaffirmed a woman’s right to receive an abortion, it also gave states more rights to regulate a woman’s ability to access one.</p>

					<p>Since the ruling went into effect, abortions in Indiana have declined by 23 percent. In 2011, 61 percent of Hoosier women lived in a county without a clinic authorized to perform abortions.</p>

					<p>Indiana passed HR1337 in 2016, which put nine new regulations on a woman’s access to abortion. A federal judge blocked this bill a week before being enacted, but State Rep. Curt Nisly announced he will introduce bill calling for the total ban on abortion in the next legislative session.</p>

					<p>This interactive will introduce you to three characters stories and take you through the process of pursuing an abortion in Indiana.</p>

					<h2>Waiting</h2>

					<div class="waiting-container">
						<p>Between your counseling appointment and your procedure, Indiana requires an 18-hour waiting period. This can be complicated by the fact that many clinics keep odd hours on only certain days of the week. To represent those 18 hours, please wait nine seconds before moving to the next step</p>

					<h2>Procedure</h2>
					<p>You arrive at the clinic to receive your abortion and are suprised to learn you have to be escorted from your car to the building. Protesters are gathered outside of the clinic with graphic photos and catchy slogans scrawled on poster board.</p>
					<img src="img/test.jpg" alt="">

					<p>You make it into the clinic, fill out your paper work and are taken into an exam room. The doctor double checks that you want to receive your abortion and upon your confirmation hands you a pill. You take the pill and the doctor hands you another to be taken at home later.</p>

					<h2>Safety</h2>
					<p>Your operation was successful. Most are. Less than one percent of abortions have a complication arise and they are considered 1/10th as dangerous as childbirth.</p>
					
					<p>Of course, you spent a week wearing a sanitary pad to work, bleeding more than you normally would even on your period, but you figure that’s a small price to pay.</p>

					<h2>Abortion rates are decreasing across Midwest, United States</h2>
					<p>The amount of women receiving an abortion per 100,000 women age 15-44 has decreased in the United States. Multiple factors, like increased contraceptive use, have lead to this decline. </p>
